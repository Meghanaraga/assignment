VotingAppObeservations
======================
Deleting Worker pod:
	cmd : kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-597ww
	1. No change in the vote and result.
	2. Due to rs the new pod got created. 
	3. Due to rolling update did not miss voting updates.
	4. As the data already pushed to db the results did not change.

Deleting DB pod:
	cmd : kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-wckcf
	1. As the pods are stateless, once it got restarted the data was lost.
	2. Result was not getting updated. 
	3. Restart happened on worker container, due to failure in db connection with restart in failure          option.
	          NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
	O/p - pod/worker-dd46d7584-597ww    1/1     Running   1          9m15s
	4. When new db came up the worker is sending data to new db pod but result app is not responding to voting app.
	5. Reason for result app not responding is socket connection is made on db by result app which is synchronous.
	6. I restarted the worker pod by deleting again.
	cmd: kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-597ww 
	
App started working:
1.	When result app was restarted (delete po on result app) then the app started working.
cmd: kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-ndxrq
2.	New connection was started and helped app to work.

Note: If all the pods are up and working, it doesnâ€™t mean app will be working correct.
